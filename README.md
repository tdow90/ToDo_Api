# ToDo_App

The goal of this app is to first, build out an API via Drango Rest Framework. My interests are in learning back end dev, so I wanted to create a to do list API that I could use in the future to add a Front end and actually use as my To do list. 

First step is to have a functional API that works
Second, will come back and create a FE to make this useable. For this part, I might get Chat GPT to build out the diesign for this and I will need to learn JS fetch or figure out some additional way to ge the FE to work with the back end.
